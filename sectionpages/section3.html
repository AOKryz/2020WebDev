  <h2>Questions:</h2>
  <<ol>
    <li>What is a table? How do you call a table, and how do you section off each cell?</li>
    <li>Why might you put the tableheader labels in the thead portion as opposed to the tbody portion?</li>
      <ul><li><em>it allows for the separate styling of the header. A more advanced example may be a header
          that stays when the table is advanced (frozen first row)</em></li>
      </ul>
    <li>What is deprecation?</li>
      <ul><li><em>The process of use stoppage for commands, or elements, that have been replaced by better,
            newer or more advanced features. An example are all the attributes for the table element. They have
            all been replaced by modification through CSS</em></li>
      </ul>
    <li>Why are forms useful?</li>
    </ol>>

    <ul>
      <li>TABLES<ul>
          <li>Used to format data in a visually pleasing, and customized way</li>
          <li>Nested inbetween &lttable>&lt/table> tags.</li>
          <li>Tables can also have Headers, Footers and Body just like the html tag.</li>
            <ul><li>headers are useful for titles. remember to use to &ltth> to input the header data.
              However, &ltth> can be called from the body, but will be styled the same as the rest of the table.</li></ul>
        </ul></li>
      <li>FORMS <ul>
          <li>Used to get user input. Have a very large variety of types of possible input.</li>
          <li>See the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form">MDN</a> for more specific information on the attributes</li>
      </ul></li>
